                                Our students love their school! And so do their parents. We love and value them in return too.    Here, children's lives are being transformed, their academic achievement is soaring, moral instruction is internalized and lived out in their daily lives and discipline is embedded in the communal life of the school.  Our mission and strategic intents are being pursued vigorously and with our God, challenges are being overcome and victories consistently won. We have cause to thank God.

The establishment of Shagari High School  in September 1995 was a product of direct response and natural progression from its precursor, the primary school that was set up two years before, in 1993. The brimming success of the primary school within three years of its operation served as a catalyst to the starting of its secondary.
El-Amin educates children from across Nigeria and promotes respect for cultural and religious values. We offer both National and International examinations namely WAEC, NECO, JAMB, IGCSE, Checkpoint (Primary and Secondary).

                                Bukenya High School provides a collage of experiences and richness of diverse cultures for the children. We endorse enthusiasm for life and learning in a manner that allows every child to excel and be valued in his/her sphere of influence. Our aim is to make leaders of these children who have self-confidence to meet the challenges of the future; the humility to acknowledge the success of others; the compassion to support others who encounter difficulties; and the maturity to take responsibility for their own actions.

Our students have participated in many national Mathematics and Science competitions and have won prizes.

                                Emmanuel Standard School was founded in the year 1995 out of a vision and a burden of the management to provide a secondary school of high academic and moral standard; a school that would groom and produce students that could fit into any situation and condition in life. The Proprietress, Mrs. Aralola Faturoti, a seasoned and well qualified educationist with over fifty years’ experience, took the burden and vision together with her strong faith and planted the seed. Today, the seed is what has now grown to become Hallmark Secondary School – the Centre of Excellence.

                               Akipov Prestige Academy's  history dates back to January 1985 when it started off as a Montessori school offering nursery education to children aged 2-5 years. Since then, the school has grown remarkably, and is today a leading institution offering a first class education from the foundation stage to post- secondary levels. We believe that offering a progressive education gives parents and pupils’ stability and continuity, removing the in-convenience of having to change schools periodically.

Sugu Secondary School has a distinguished and award-winning reputation which includes being the top school in Ondo State and one of the top schools in Nigeria. Indisputably, to the glory of God, the school is a force to be reckoned with in the educational sector, not only in Nigeria but internationally. Our school is conveniently located in the peaceful outskirt of Yola town, a major city in Adamawa State (fondly referred to as the “Sunshine state”) which is in the western part of Nigeria. It sits on a large expanse of land in a quiet and serene environment on the main road that is easily accessible to major parts of the country.

                                This school is in response to the high demand for a school that upholds virtues and creates an avenue where teachers can collaborate with parents in their most important role of educating their children. It is a school founded on the inspirations and teachings of St. Josemaria (Founder of Opus Dei) who believed that parents are the primary educators of their children. He also believed that teachers were to work with parents in every phase of their education, giving due consideration to the differences in gender  while not forgetting the proper ends Divine Providence assigns to each child in the family and society.

                               The Regent Secondary School offers an inclusive, academically challenging and selective, co-educational British-style Day and Boarding school education to some 350 local, national and international students from Years 7 to 11.

The British National curriculum is adapted for years 7 and 8, with CIE Examinations in Year 9, and the prestigious IGCSE Curriculum and external examinations in Years 10 and 11.

The Regent Secondary School is a new, purpose-built campus with state-of-the-art ICT, library and sporting facilities.
Our mission is to develop responsible global citizens, and to cultivate leadership through academic excellence.

For more than 14 years, The Regent Family of Schools has worked hard to establish itself as a well-known, first-rate educational choice for students and parents in Abuja and beyond. Teachers, board members, non-academic staff and friends of the school work together in a collegial manner to achieve excellence, and everything we do is student-centered.
Although academic achievement is our priority, we also place emphasis on a comprehensive Co-curricular Activities Program where there is something to offer every student, whether it is academically related, sports or other activities of interest.
